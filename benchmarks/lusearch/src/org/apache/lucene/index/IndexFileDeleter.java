/*
 * This class keeps track of each SegmentInfos instance that
 * is still "live", either because it corresponds to a
 * segments_N file in the Directory (a "commit", i.e. a
 * committed SegmentInfos) or because it's an in-memory
 * SegmentInfos that a writer is actively updating but has
 * not yet committed.  This class uses simple reference
 * counting to map the live SegmentInfos instances to
 * individual files in the Directory.
 *
 * When autoCommit=true, IndexWriter currently commits only
 * on completion of a merge (though this may change with
 * time: it is not a guarantee).  When autoCommit=false,
 * IndexWriter only commits when it is closed.  Regardless
 * of autoCommit, the user may call IndexWriter.commit() to
 * force a blocking commit.
 * 
 * The same directory file may be referenced by more than
 * one IndexCommit, i.e. more than one SegmentInfos.
 * Therefore we count how many commits reference each file.
 * When all the commits referencing a certain file have been
 * deleted, the refcount for that file becomes zero, and the
 * file is deleted.
 *
 * A separate deletion policy interface
 * (IndexDeletionPolicy) is consulted on creation (onInit)
 * and once per commit (onCommit), to decide when a commit
 * should be removed.
 * 
 * It is the business of the IndexDeletionPolicy to choose
 * when to delete commit points.  The actual mechanics of
 * file deletion, retrying, etc, derived from the deletion
 * of commit points is the business of the IndexFileDeleter.
 * 
 * The current default deletion policy is {@link
 * KeepOnlyLastCommitDeletionPolicy}, which removes all
 * prior commits when a new commit has completed.  This
 * matches the behavior before 2.2.
 *
 * Note that you must hold the write.lock before
 * instantiating this class.  It opens segments_N file(s)
 * directly with no retry logic.
