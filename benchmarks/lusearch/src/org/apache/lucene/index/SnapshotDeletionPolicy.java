/** A {@link IndexDeletionPolicy} that wraps around any other
 *  {@link IndexDeletionPolicy} and adds the ability to hold and
 *  later release a single "snapshot" of an index.  While
 *  the snapshot is held, the {@link IndexWriter} will not
 *  remove any files associated with it even if the index is
 *  otherwise being actively, arbitrarily changed.  Because
 *  we wrap another arbitrary {@link IndexDeletionPolicy}, this
 *  gives you the freedom to continue using whatever {@link
 *  IndexDeletionPolicy} you would normally want to use with your
 *  index.  Note that you can re-use a single instance of
 *  SnapshotDeletionPolicy across multiple writers as long
 *  as they are against the same index Directory.  Any
 *  snapshot held when a writer is closed will "survive"
 *  when the next writer is opened.
 *
 * <p><b>WARNING</b>: This API is a new and experimental and
 * may suddenly change.</p> */
