/*************************************************************************
 *  Compilation:  javac Graph.java
 *  Dependencies: ST.java SET.java In.java
 *  
 *  Undirected graph data type implemented using a symbol table
 *  whose keys are vertices (String) and whose values are sets
 *  of neighbors (SET of Strings).
 *
 *  Remarks
 *  -------
 *   - Parallel edges are not allowed
 *   - Self-loop are allowed
 *   - Adjacency lists store many different copies of the same
 *     String. You can use less memory by interning the strings.

/**
 *  The <tt>Graph</tt> class represents an undirected graph of vertices
 *  with string names.
 *  It supports the following operations: add an edge, add a vertex,
 *  get all of the vertices, iterate over all of the neighbors adjacent
 *  to a vertex, is there a vertex, is there an edge between two vertices.
 *  Self-loops are permitted; parallel edges are discarded.
